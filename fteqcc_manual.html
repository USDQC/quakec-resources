<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>QuakeC is a language originally created by ID software for use in in the
video game Quake. Vanilla QuakeC is quite a limited language, however with qcc
improvements and engine extensions, its less annoying to write and also much
more capable as a programming language.

Today we're dealing with different types of modules. The original QuakeC only
supported the modification of game-code run on the server. It was not capable
of altering any client-side behaviour. Just send a selection of commands and
hope that the client interprets the stuff properly.</p>
<h4>Server-Side QuakeC (SSQC)</h4>
<p>This is the classic form of QuakeC, and is the module executed by the server
component. SSQC's reason to exist is so that it can deal with networking. 
It is normally considered authoritive, which is a fancy way of saying that CSQC
isn't to be trusted (if only due to packetloss). 
As such, the SSQC is normally expected to track the state of any entity that has
any impact on the outcome of a game.

In mods designed to run without CSQC, the SSQC generally does a lot more than
just that, however it is also potentially running on a computer on the other
side of the planet, so while you can write your entire game in just the SSQC
module, doing so means that you have no control over the user's actual screen,
and anything that is displayed can be quite laggy which may limit what you can
expect to achieve with SSQC alone.

There are two major variations of SSQC:</p>
<ol>
  <li>NetQuake (NQ):
The original and more common type.</li>
<li>QuakeWorld (QW):
Which was originally meant for deathmatch only. 
It streamlines some things but in the process has a number of omissions that
break singleplayer quake (most qw mods lack any singleplayer/coop logic, with
no support for any monsters).

Thus most engines focus on NQ, even FTEQW!
SSQC tends to be very object orientated. There are comparatively few
non-constant globals as multiple pontential players/etc hinder the use of such
individual globals.</li>
