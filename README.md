# Work in progress : QuakeC Resources

## About the project

We (Chuma and Shadowelite7) decided to make this small documentation project that aims to gather the most useful resources of QuakeC into a single github.

At least to help for getting the referencial info on QuakeC.

We've decided to gather all the most useful resources referenced by the people that have been coding in QuakeC... to help newcomers and veterans in condensing the information in one place.
